Ideas:
1) Perception mechanism
     Means, we can create a software where computer will explain a picture. 
2) PPDT by computer
     PPDT is a test for defence aspirants. We can make computer describe and write story perceived by the image. 
3) Software where we can search for tunes, music and videos. 
     Like in google, we can search by typing and speaking. But for music if someone doesn't remember words, then we can create a software where by singing tunes we can get a whole song.
4) AI project for total production, consumption and requirement. And then we can simulate it, which then tell us what to produce in what quantity.
